This is DigOutBox controller `gui_v0.2.0`.

Please read the readme file for more information on how to set up and use this program. You can find it [here](https://github.com/galactic-forensics/DigOutBox/tree/main/controller).

**Important**: This version of the GUI needs the DigOutBox firmware version `v0.2.0` or higher and requires CLI version `v0.2.0` or higher.

Fixes/enhancements in this version:

- Software lockout functionality has been added to the GUI. If software lockout is activated via the remote, the GUI will not be able to change the state of the channels. The GUI will still be able to read the state of the channels.
- Extended help via tooltips
